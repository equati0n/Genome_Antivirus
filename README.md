## About  
This is an antivirus interface. The current functionalities are limited to comparing signatures.
  
## How to run the program  
Start Qt in administrator mode by right clicking your Qt shortcut/icon and select run as administrator. You will most likely get a permissions error in the console and the program will not run if you do not start Qt with administrator privileges. Select File->Open FIle or Project.. and navigate to the GenomeAntivirus.pro file. The program should run now.
